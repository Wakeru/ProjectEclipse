<body>
    this is the body and some functions about what to do with it!
    You can tab the tags/functions but they wont change anything i think.
    Tabbing is meant for organization and neatness!
            <h1> This is Header 1</h1>
                <h2> This is Header 2</h2>
    <h6> All the way to Header 6!</h6>
    <q> This is a quotation</q>
    
    <hr>

    <p> The thing above me is kinda like a barrier to seperate themes! But anyways this is for longer snetence, or paragraphs! in addition you can use the: <blockquote>The block quote!</blockquote></p>
    <pre>this is a pre element text</pre>

    <hr>

    <h2> Now for an image: </h2>
            <img src="images/logo_test.png"
            width="100" height="50"
            alt="Alternative text is in case the image cannot load correctly then this text loads to explain!"
            title="this is the title text! THis shows when you hover over the image!">

    <h4>You do not need to declare a width or height, as it will use the dedefault that the image came in with. U can use only width if the image is too large!</h4>

    <h1>What about an image from the internet? no download  required!</h1>
        <img src="https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/branding/app-icon.png"
        alt="Error, where the image at?">
