    The sun sets, the sky turns red <br>
The day is done, it's time for bed<br>
But in our dreams, we'll soar and fly<br>
Until the morning, when we'll rise and try<br>
To make the most of every moment<br>
And cherish life, like a precious ornament. <br>
<br>
The wind whispers secrets in my ear<br>
Of places far and journeys near<br>
It tells of stories yet untold<br>
And mysteries waiting to unfold<br>
So I spread my wings and take flight<br>
To explore the world with all my might.<br>
<br><hr><br>
In the midst of a bustling city,<br>
Where the streets are always busy,<br>
There stands a park, serene and green,<br>
A peaceful haven, a refreshing scene.<br>
<br>
Here the air is clean and fresh,<br>
And the noise of traffic seems to mesh<br>
Into the sounds of nature's voice,<br>
As birds chirp and butterflies rejoice.<br>
<br>
Tall trees sway in the gentle breeze,<br>
Providing shade for all to ease<br>
Their minds and bodies, weary from work,<br>
And rest in this tranquil perk.<br>
<br>
Children play and run around,<br>
Their laughter a joyful sound,<br>
While couples sit and hold hands,<br>
Enjoying the beauty of these lands.<br>
<br>
The pond reflects the bright blue sky,<br>
As ducks and geese go swimming by,<br>
And in the distance, a fountain sprays,<br>
Its mist a cooling, refreshing haze.<br>
<br>
In this oasis, time seems to stand still,<br>
As worries and stress seem to disappear at will,<br>
And one can simply breathe and be,<br>
In the embrace of nature's majesty.<br>
<br>
So when life gets too hectic and fast,<br>
And you need a break to make it last,<br>
Come to this park and find your peace,<br>
And let your soul and mind release.<br>
